## Comprehensive Exercise: Create Your Basic Portfolio Webpage

### Objective:
Apply the HTML knowledge acquired from Day 1 to create a basic personal portfolio webpage. This webpage will serve as a foundation for showcasing your skills, projects, interests, and contact information.

### Requirements:

- **Page Structure**: Use proper HTML document structure, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **Title**: Include a `<title>` tag in the `<head>` section that names your portfolio.
- **Headings**: Utilize heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to create a clear, hierarchical structure for your content. For example, `<h1>` for your name or the main title of your portfolio, `<h2>` for section titles like "About Me," "Projects," and "Contact."
- **Paragraphs**: Use paragraph (`<p>`) tags to add a brief introduction about yourself in the "About Me" section and descriptions for each project.
- **Links**: Incorporate anchor (`<a>`) tags to link to your professional profiles (like LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.), email address, or any external websites you want to share. Make sure to use the `target="_blank"` attribute to open links in a new tab.
- **Images**: Embed at least one image (e.g., a profile picture or project screenshots) using the `<img>` tag. Remember to include the `alt` attribute for accessibility.
- **Video** (Optional): If you have a video introduction of yourself or a video showcasing one of your projects, embed it using the `<video>` tag with controls enabled.

### Instructions:

1. **Plan Your Content**: Before coding, briefly plan the layout and content of your portfolio. Decide on the sections you'll include and the information you want to present.
2. **Code the Structure**: Start by coding the basic HTML structure of your webpage. Organize your content using the appropriate heading levels.
3. **Add Text Content**: Fill in your headings and paragraphs with your personal information, project descriptions, and any other content you want to include.
4. **Incorporate Multimedia**: Add your profile picture, project images, and optional video. Ensure you position them appropriately within your content.
5. **Link to External Sites**: Add links to your professional profiles, project repositories, or any other external references you find relevant.
6. **Review and Test**: Once you've completed your webpage, review your code and content for any errors. Test your links and multimedia elements to ensure they work as expected.

### Submission:

- Submit the HTML file of your portfolio webpage. If you've referenced any external images or videos hosted online, ensure the URLs are accessible.

### Tips for Success:

- **Keep It Simple**: Focus on creating a clean and navigable structure. The aesthetics can be enhanced later with CSS.
- **Be Creative**: While the technical skills are important, also think about how you want to present yourself and your work. This is your chance to start defining your online presence.
- **Validate Your HTML**: Use a tool like the W3C HTML Validator to check your HTML for errors or issues.


## Additional Session: Preparing for the Next Lesson

### Objective:
Prepare for the upcoming lesson by researching and implementing new HTML elements. This session focuses on creating an unordered list to display a list of skills and a table to outline work experience, enhancing the portfolio project.

### Part 1: Display Skills Using an Unordered List

- **Task**: Add an unordered list (`<ul>`) to your portfolio page to display a list of skills or technologies you're familiar with. Each skill should be listed as a bullet point using the list item (`<li>`) tag.

### Part 2: Outline Work Experience Using a Table

- **Task**: Create a table that outlines your work experience. The table should have 5 rows and 3 columns, including a header row. The columns will represent the timeline, company name, and job title, respectively.

### Instructions:

#### For the Unordered List:

1. **Research**: Look up how to create an unordered list in HTML if you're not already familiar.
2. **Implement**:
   - Directly below your "About Me" section, add a new section titled "Skills".
   - Inside this section, create an unordered list. Each list item should represent a skill or technology you're proficient in.

#### For the Table:

1. **Research**: Review how to create and structure tables in HTML, focusing on the use of `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` tags.
2. **Implement**:
   - Add a new section titled "Work Experience".
   - Create a table with a header row labeling each column: "Timeline", "Company Name", and "Title".
   - Fill in the table with your work experience. If actual work experience is limited, feel free to include volunteer positions, internships, or project involvement.
